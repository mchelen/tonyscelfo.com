Dr. ColorChip

Sometimes is sucks to own nice things... especially when bad things happen to those nice things. But at the end of the day, they are just things and they can be fixed or replaced.

For example... today I found a large scratch on my car after I got it washed. It could have happened at the car wash or it could have happened days ago since it was on the passenger side. The only thing I know for sure is that it happened after the last time I filled up with gas.

A while back, I had bought a [Dr. ColorChip](http://www.drcolorchip.com/) kit to fix a few small rock chips and I decided to try it on the scratch.

Dr. ColorChip works by combining a color matched paint with a special solution that can slowly dissolve the paint. You work by applying paint to the affected area and then smearing it in with a latex glove to leave a thin coating. After its dry, you lightly buff the excess paint away with a special pink solution that does all the work. The whole process took about three and a half hours. Fifteen minutes to paint each of two coats, an hour for each coat to dry and a half hour to dissolve off the excess paint from each coat.
